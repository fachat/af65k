HOWTO generate code
-------------------

The subdirectories in this directory are eclipse(tm) - http://www.eclipse.org - 
Java IDE projects. These need to be imported into an eclipse workspace and can
then be executed from within the IDE.

0) Install the "egit" eclipse plugin to support repository handling in eclipse
   (optional)

1) start eclipse, create a new workspace outside this git repository

2) "File" -> "Import" , in the popup window select "General" -> "Existing Projects into Workspace"
   then click "Next". Check "Select root directory" and browse to this directory.
   Select all projects. Make sure that "Copy projects into workspace" is NOT selected!
   Click Finish

3) Some of the projects contain a Java launcher configuration that can directly be
   started from the eclipse IDE:

	de.fachat.65k: 		DocGenerator.launch	
		-> creates the opcode tables for the documentation
	de.fachat.65k.optvhdl:	Optimized.launch
		-> uses a Quine-McCluskey algorithm to determine 
		   optimized logic equations for addressing modes and
		   operations
	de.fachat.65k.vhdlgen:	VhdlGen.launch
		-> creates the opmap VHDL decoding tables for the VHDL core

   All those generators use the af65002.xml file stored in de.fachat.65k as 
   input
